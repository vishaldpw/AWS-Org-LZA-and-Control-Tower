# üõ†Ô∏è AWS Multi-Account Setup ‚Äì Beginner-Friendly Flow

This guide explains how key AWS services work together to create and manage secure, compliant AWS accounts.

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Flow

### üîπ Step 1: Account Creation  
**Control Tower** creates a new AWS account using **AWS Organizations**.

- AWS Organizations helps link and manage accounts.
- Control Tower uses its **Account Factory** to create accounts in a structured way.

---

### üîπ Step 2: Applying Policies & Setup  
**Control Tower** uses **AWS Service Catalog** to apply **standard configurations** and **guardrails**.

- Sets up networking, logging, and SCPs (Service Control Policies).
- Automates CloudTrail, Config, VPC, etc.
- Service Catalog is used behind the scenes by Control Tower.

---

### üîπ Step 3: Ongoing Compliance Check  
**AWS Config** continuously checks if all configurations and rules are being followed.

- Uses **Config Rules** like:
  - "S3 buckets should not be public"
  - "CloudTrail must be enabled"
- Can alert or auto-remediate if something goes out of compliance.

## üõ°Ô∏è Where Are Policies Defined?

| Location | Policy Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **AWS Organizations** | SCP (Service Control Policy) | Restricts what services/accounts can do (e.g., deny S3 public access) |
| **IAM / IAM Identity Center** | IAM Policies | Grants or denies permissions to users and roles |
| **AWS Config** | Config Rules | Detects and monitors configuration drift or security violations |

## üîç Summary of Tools and Their Roles

| Service | Purpose | Role in Setup |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| **AWS Organizations** | Manages accounts and applies SCPs | Foundation layer |
| **Control Tower** | Automates account setup and applies guardrails | Main manager |
| **Service Catalog** | Defines templates for account/service setup | Backend engine |
| **AWS Config** | Monitors compliance with rules | Ongoing compliance checker |
| **IAM Identity Center** | Manages access for users across accounts | Central access management |
| **Landing Zone Accelerator (LZA)** | Adds advanced compliance and security tooling | Enterprise-grade add-on |
| **Account Factory for Terraform (AFT)** | Automates account creation using Terraform | Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) layer |

# üõ°Ô∏è AWS Control Types: Preventive, Detective, and Corrective

| **Control Type** | **Purpose**                          | **AWS Services Used**                      | **Examples** |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
| ‚úÖ Preventive     | Stop unauthorized or unsafe actions | - AWS Organizations (SCPs)  <br> - IAM Policies <br> - Security Groups <br> - NACLs | - Deny S3 public write in SCP <br> - IAM policy blocks EC2 termination <br> - Security Group denies SSH from 0.0.0.0 |
| üîç Detective      | Detect violations or misconfigurations | - AWS Config <br> - CloudTrail <br> - CloudWatch Alarms <br> - GuardDuty / Macie | - Detect if S3 bucket is public <br> - Alert on root user login <br> - Detect unencrypted EBS volumes |
| üõ†Ô∏è Corrective     | Automatically fix detected issues   | - AWS Config Remediation <br> - Lambda Automation <br> - SSM Automation | - Auto-remove public ACL from S3 <br> - Auto-tag EC2 instances <br> - Patch non-compliant EC2s automatically |

These controls help you enforce security and compliance in AWS accounts, especially when used with Control Tower, AWS Organizations, and LZA.
