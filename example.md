🔧 Step-by-Step Real-World Setup
✅ 1. AWS Organizations Setup
Management Account (root account)

Create Organizational Units (OUs):

Security

Infrastructure

Sandbox

Workloads

✅ 2. Enable AWS Control Tower
Control Tower sets up the following accounts and guardrails automatically:

Account Name	Purpose
Audit Account	Stores CloudTrail logs, AWS Config logs
Log Archive	Stores all logs from all accounts centrally
Shared Services	Hosts things like DNS, Active Directory, CI/CD tools
Account Factory	Used to create new project or team accounts

Control Tower also enables mandatory guardrails:

CloudTrail must be enabled

No disabled Config

No delete of logging buckets

And allows optional guardrails:

Disallow changes to IAM policies

Disallow internet access in certain OUs

✅ 3. Accounts Created via Account Factory
They use Account Factory to create accounts for environments:

OU	Accounts Created
Workloads	dev-app1, qa-app1, prod-app1
Sandbox	developer-vishal, developer-anita

Each account:

Inherits security policies (SCPs)

Sends logs to central S3 bucket

Has limited permissions per OU

✅ 4. Guardrails in Action
Examples of Control Tower guardrails applied:

❌ Dev accounts cannot create internet-facing ELBs

✅ Prod accounts must have CloudTrail enabled

❌ No account can use root user

✅ 5. IAM Identity Center (SSO)
Set up for users:

Devs get access to only dev-* accounts

Ops team gets access to all prod-* accounts

Security team has access to everything via Audit and Security accounts

🔒 Optional Step: Add Landing Zone Accelerator (LZA)
AcmeTech is regulated by ISO 27001 & NIST 800-53, so they add LZA to:

Enforce encryption policies

Add centralized DNS with Route53 Resolver rules

Add more advanced logging (VPC flow logs, GuardDuty, Macie)

Automate account baselines (pre-installed security agents)
