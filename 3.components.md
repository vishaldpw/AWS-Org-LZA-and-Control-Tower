# üõ†Ô∏è AWS Multi-Account Setup ‚Äì Beginner-Friendly Flow

This guide explains how key AWS services work together to create and manage secure, compliant AWS accounts.

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Flow

### üîπ Step 1: Account Creation  
**Control Tower** creates a new AWS account using **AWS Organizations**.

- AWS Organizations helps link and manage accounts.
- Control Tower uses its **Account Factory** to create accounts in a structured way.

---

### üîπ Step 2: Applying Policies & Setup  
**Control Tower** uses **AWS Service Catalog** to apply **standard configurations** and **guardrails**.

- Sets up networking, logging, and SCPs (Service Control Policies).
- Automates CloudTrail, Config, VPC, etc.
- Service Catalog is used behind the scenes by Control Tower.

---

### üîπ Step 3: Ongoing Compliance Check  
**AWS Config** continuously checks if all configurations and rules are being followed.

- Uses **Config Rules** like:
  - "S3 buckets should not be public"
  - "CloudTrail must be enabled"
- Can alert or auto-remediate if something goes out of compliance.
