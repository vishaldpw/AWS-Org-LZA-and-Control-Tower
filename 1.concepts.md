# AWS Organizations, Control Tower, and Landing Zone Accelerator (LZA)

This document provides a clear and structured overview of three key AWS services used to manage and govern multi-account environments: **AWS Organizations**, **AWS Control Tower**, and the **AWS Landing Zone Accelerator (LZA)**.

---

## AWS Organizations

AWS Organizations provides the foundational structure for managing multiple AWS accounts in a centralized manner. It allows you to group accounts into Organizational Units (OUs), apply Service Control Policies (SCPs), and enable consolidated billing.

**Key Features:**
- Central management of multiple AWS accounts.
- Application of service control policies across accounts.
- Consolidated billing for all member accounts.
- Structuring accounts based on environment, function, or team.

## AWS Control Tower

AWS Control Tower is a higher-level service built on top of AWS Organizations and other AWS services such as AWS Config, AWS CloudTrail, and IAM. It simplifies the process of setting up and governing a secure, multi-account AWS environment based on AWS best practices.

**Core Capabilities:**
- Automates the creation and configuration of new accounts.
- Applies preventive and detective guardrails to enforce compliance.
- Centralizes logging using AWS CloudTrail and S3.
- Provides a dashboard to monitor account status and compliance.

**Control Tower Automatically Sets Up:**
- **Audit Account**: Central collection point for logs and API activity.
- **Log Archive Account**: Stores all logs from all accounts.
- **Shared Services Account**: Hosts shared resources like DNS or Active Directory.

## AWS Landing Zone Accelerator (LZA)

The AWS Landing Zone Accelerator builds on top of Control Tower to provide more advanced configurations required by enterprises with strict security, compliance, or operational needs. It helps automate the deployment of a secure, compliant, multi-account AWS environment aligned with frameworks like NIST, CIS, and ISO.

**Enhancements Over Control Tower:**
- Pre-configured compliance frameworks.
- Centralized DNS with Route 53 Resolver rules.
- Advanced logging and threat detection (GuardDuty, Macie, etc.).
- Automation of baseline security tooling in all accounts.
