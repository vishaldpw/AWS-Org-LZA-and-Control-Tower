🏢 AWS Organizations
	"I want to manage multiple AWS accounts."
	It gives the foundation to link and organize accounts centrally.

🛫 AWS Control Tower
More like a higher-level service that uses AWS Organizations and other AWS services under the hood to help set up and govern a secure, multi-account environment.
	"I want AWS to help me create and manage a well-architected multi-account setup with guardrails, logging, and centralized governance."
It provides automation + governance.

🚀 AWS Landing Zone Accelerator (LZA)
It’s more like a companion solution or an extension, built on top of Control Tower, for organizations that need more customization.
	"I need a more secure, compliant, and highly customized environment — LZA extends what Control Tower does."

🧰 What tools and features does AWS Control Tower offer?
Here are the main components/tools used or managed by AWS Control Tower:

🧱 1. AWS Organizations
	• Used in the background to create and manage accounts.

🧾 2. Account Factory
	• A self-service account vending machine.
	• Helps you create new AWS accounts in a controlled and standardized way.
	• You can use a GUI or API (Account Factory for Terraform).

🛡️ 3. Guardrails (Preventive & Detective)
	• Built using AWS Config and Service Control Policies (SCPs).
	• Help enforce rules like:
		○ No public S3 buckets.
		○ Require CloudTrail enabled.
		○ No changes to IAM policies.

📜 4. AWS Config Rules
	• Used for compliance checks (detective guardrails).
	• Ensures accounts stay in a compliant state.

📦 5. Centralized Logging
	• Uses AWS CloudTrail and AWS S3.
	• Logs from all accounts go to a central logging account.

🔐 6. AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO)
	• Optional.
	• Helps manage user access across accounts centrally.

⚙️ 7. Lifecycle Events & Notifications
	• Triggered when:
		○ New accounts are created.
		○ Guardrails are violated.
		○ Resources drift.
	• Uses Amazon SNS.

🔧 8. Integration with AWS CloudFormation / Terraform
	• You can extend Control Tower with Customizations for Control Tower (CfCT) or Account Factory for Terraform (AFT).
